This was a simple test project in which I was learning about Bootstrap.  I learned that it speeds creation time tremendously, but does increase the 'technical debt' as going back to edit it can be tricky as much of the code is from Bootstrap and I have to refer to documentation repeatedly to remember what some of the shorthand classes are doing.
